# Source code:
==============

Here we have the source code for our network.


# Convolutional Neural Network:
===============================

Right now, our network is a simple convolutional neural network. It takes in the 2**19 long vector and reduces it to 2**11 which we then feed to 2 fully conncected neural network layer.

# Recurrent Network:
====================

The above example isn't very good for this type of job. The best would be a recurrent network and I am going to make one in coming weeks. However, I am a bit too intimidated by them (especially in TF) so I am going to spend sometime researching them before I jump in.

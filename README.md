# GenreRecognition
A small neural network project with the intent to create a classifier capable of recognising different genres.

This is part of our course, CISC 452, in Queen's University in Canada. 
# Note:
This project is discontinued. 

While there were so good ideas (which I would like to test out in the future projects), but the lack of data and resources make this project very hard to continue.
